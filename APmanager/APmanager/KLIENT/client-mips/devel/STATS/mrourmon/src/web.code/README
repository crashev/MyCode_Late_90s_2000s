Files in the back-end of ourmon:

30 second crontab driver utilities:
-----------------------------------

omupdate.pl - perl back-end calls rrdtool and drawtopn (topn)
	and does ourmon logging if desired of topn lists

tcpworm.pl - called to digest front-end produced tcpworm.txt which
	is not done by omupdate.pl.  produces portreport.txt and tcpworm.txt
	(same name as input file) which are available on the web,
	and provide a different view of data associated with ip_srcs
	deemed suspicious.

	This can also be run manually and used to take the raw tcpworm.txt file 
	and process it doing reverse DNS lookup.  There is no DNS lookup
	in the runtime 30 second snapshot of course.

monbackup.pl - used to copy mon.lite file and tcpworm.txt into their respective
	logging directories (typically after or before omupdate.pl runs) 

drawtopn.c - topn histogram drawing program, called by omupdate.pl to
		create histograms.

wormtolog.pl - run by back-end shellscript.  takes tcpworm.txt and converts
	it to a log-file style file.  This is done for the sake of the hourly
	batch script, ombatchsyn.pl.

Misc/test utilities and other files:
-------------------------------------

Makefile - for compile of drawtopn
testdraw.sh - script for testing drawtopn
udptest.sh - another script for testing drawtopn
daily.pl - perl script run at midnight to prepare ourmon logs directory for
		next days logging. 

hourly ourmon batch logging scripts
---------------------------------------------------------
ombatchip.pl - Flow logs are input. sort produces top of top report.
	This one produces top ip flows, etc.
ombatchipsrc.pl - Flow logs are input.  sort produces top of top report.
	This one produces top IP src and top IP dst reports.
ombatchsyn.pl - topn_syn log "sort" produces top of top report. 
	This is done for the topn syn list.  It is also run
	on the tcpworm.txt file since it has the same format,
	in order to produce a daily "summary" of worm activity
	as well.

# analysis tools - not part of regular runtime ourmon system
#	These can be used for log analysis at a later time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
makepics.pl - for topn and top syn, generate a web directory of pictures
	based on an input time and a number of syslog entries (instances).
	This is an analysis tool and is not part of the ourmon runtime system.
	It needs work, but may be useful for taking logging info and turning
	it into a web-based set of pictures so that you can browse an interesting
	occurance in terms of typical ourmon topn pictures.

Experimental code
-----------------

topipa.pl - summarizer of log data.  goal is to produce 30 second and hourly
	report of top of the top ip_src found in more than 1 type of top_n log.
