1. hardwired filter that counts
	tcp/udp/icmp/xtra pkts, not bytes

2. make the omupdate.pl program deal with 10..100 top flows 
in graphs of 10 at a time a la what the new top port facility does.

3. rewrite drawtopn totally ... make the graphs horizontal as opposed
to vertical.  Throw out the DNS code as it doesn't work on linux.
It isn't reasonable anymore for the back-end to do DNS within 30
seconds.  Too many attackers ... caching does help.  But not
clear if it is enough to get done within the time period.
