<H3>  TOP 40 tcp syn generating IP addresses, syn count/fin count/rst count (back to this ip)
</H3> 
<p>
We sort on syn count per sample period (30 seconds).  The syns/fins/reset and total tcp pkts in both directions are shown. 
Syns are counted as sent from a particular ip src.  Fins and resets are counted as pkts being
sent back to a particular ip src.  Syns, Fins, and resets as well as ordinary
packets sent/to from a particular ip src are included in the total count.  The total count is
thus a hopefully close approximation of all TCP pkts sent to/from an individual
address and may be viewed as a count of TCP work.  We compute and show a percent
that is simply the percent of tcp control packets divided by the total number of packets.
<p>
In general, it is not good if the percent is high (near 100%) because that means
that there is only TCP control, and little data.
If the percent of tcp control (syns/fins/resets) to total packets is 90% or above we
give the ip source a "W" flag.  If the percent is between 50..90% we give the ip source
a "w" flag, else we say nothing.  We have determined that P2P apps such as gnutella
and kazaa may appear as syn scanners, but with this weight measure, they typically
score a combined weight of 30% or less in terms of control/total packets.
That said, a VERY successful scanning/worm might of course have a lot "successful"
two-way traffic as well (to say nothing a very successful gnutella worm combination).

<p>
Guide to legend info below.  A 2-tuple of legend/syn count is displayed. The top legend includes the
following information:
<br> 
<br> 
ip address: f (count of fins): r (count of resets): t (total 2-way pkts): percent of control/total: W or w flag
<br> 
<br> 
Underneath the legend we show the total syn count which is used for the topn syn sort.
