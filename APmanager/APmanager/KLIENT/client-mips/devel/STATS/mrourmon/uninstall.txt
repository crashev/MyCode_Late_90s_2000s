There is no way to auto deinstall ourmon at this point.
It isn't that hard to uninstall though (discounting dependencies).

We assume ourmon scripts are installed in /home/mrourmon/bin
We suggest you remove /home/mrourmon last.

1. front-end install 

1.1  turn off the ourmon front-end
	# cd ~mrourmon/bin
	# ./ourmon.sh stop
	
1.2 rc boot cleanup

On BSD clean up

/usr/local/etc/rc.d  remove ourmon.sh

On Linux clean up

/etc/rc.d/rc.local - remove ourmon.sh line

2. back-end install 

/etc/crontab - remove these entries

############## ourmon crontab entries ###############
# run ourmon back-end omupdate.pl etc. per minute
*/1	*	*	*	*	root	/usr/home/mrourmon/bin/omupdate.sh
# batchip.sh - hourly log summary
0	*	*	*	*	root	/usr/home/mrourmon/bin/batchip.sh
# batchipall.sh - roll over logs at almost midnight
59	23	*	*	*	root	/usr/home/mrourmon/bin/batchipall.sh
# daily.pl - re init logs at midnight
0	0	*	*	*	root	/usr/home/mrourmon/bin/daily.pl /usr/home/mrourmon/logs

wait one minute!  (or use ps -ax to check to see if anything is running, you can kill them
of course)

3. rm -fr /home/mrourmon last.

4. remove the directory for web.pages ... e.g., /usr/local/www/data/ourmon
or /usr/local/apache/htdocs/ourmon ... up to you where you put it.
