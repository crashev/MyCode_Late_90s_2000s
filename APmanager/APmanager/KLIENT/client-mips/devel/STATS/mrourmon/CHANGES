ourmon 2.4

1. bug fix in omupdate.pl.  count display in rrdtool graphs
for bpf expressions counted as packets was WRONG!.  inflated
by 8.  Using same rrdtool expression for bits/sec, and pkts/sec.  

2. new topn syn list mechanism.  portreport.txt in particular which
is a view of all worms and other top SYN generators
attacking from the ourmon agent network vantage point.
portreport.txt is a very nice feature.  See info.html for details.

3. topn syn in front end may optionally be somewhat sorted by
WORK metric.  sorted by syn count by default.

4. omupdate.pl code rewritten so that topn_ip flow monitor can show 10..100
(10 per graph) top flows.  No longer fixed to around 10.  Same for
the topn port scanner code as well.  

5. icmp/udp error code in front-end rewritten to include sampled
ports for udp (now in mon.lite).  There is now a udpreport.txt file
similar in some sense to portreport.txt for udp transgressions.

6. secview.html no longer exists as it is too much trouble.  Make your own.

7. info.html rewrite - now has TOC.  

8. configure.pl rewrite to make it relative to pwd. 

9. portreport.txt stored away in logs.

10. logging is NOT optional any more.

11. event log mechanism exists to allow front-end to pass "event" messages
(like reboot) to back-end.

12. nasty boot bug on FreeBSD fixed.  SIGHUP out of nowhere causes ourmon
front-end to exit.  We now ignore SIGHUP.  SIGKILL ourmon to make it go away.

ourmon 2.3

New features:

ourmon has many new IDS/anomaly detection features.  See the info.html
file for full information.  This includes a set of top N mechanisms
that look for scanning in various ways including: 

	1. ip address, and L4 port
	scanning 1 to many destination,  
	2. TCP syn scanning, 
	3. UDP/ICMP errors,
	4. and various supplied BPF and/or RRDtool-based graphs that look for network-wide
	signs of scanning impact including TCP errors, ICMP unreachable errors,
	and flow counts to name a few.  

The tcpsyn hash mechanism also has a very interesting meta counter that counts the number of 
tcp syn scanners (worms?!) showing up at a sight, and can clearly detect distributed zombie attacks.   

The topn flow mechanism in ourmon has been heavily optimized.  Thanks
to Bart Massey for able assistance.

The ourmon front-end is probably now for the 1st time safe to run
on linux.  See INSTALL for details on that notion.  We are still
using FreeBSD as we suspect that BSD is more efficient with the BPF
buffer system in the kernel, compared to Linux and its packet socket
implementation (BSD can trim packets in the kernel.  Linux apparently
does not do that.  We would be happy to be told we were wrong about that
with a measurement experiment to back it up).

1. topn basic mechanism now includes RRDTOOL strip chart graph
to graph the # of flows (ip, tcp, udp, icmp) seen per sample period; i.e.,
flows per second.  This is useful in terms of DOS attacks especially
if there are a large # of them, e.g., say w32/welchia/nachia worms
doing ICMP flows or mass TCP syn scanning.  A baseline here for normal behavior is important.
The graph is flows/sec.

2. The front-end bpf graph configuration has a new feature: 
One can specify the bpf-set of graphs to be either packets or bytes in
terms of counts for the entire graph. Thus you can toggle
the bpf graph as a whole (a set of lines) between 
counting packet size as bits/sec or just simply counting the packets
as packets/second.

3. ourmon topn hash mechanism has been made more efficient.  stats are produced
in the front end to give some idea of how well the hash is doing.  The insert
count is graphed (each insert represents a malloc), as this is useful for detection
of large scale DOS or TCP syn attacks.

4. new topn_syn mechanism for tracking tcp scanners.  It seems to be doing
a rather good job at PSU.  However we are seeing worms, not "trinity".
Note that as a side effect it produces an RRDTOOL graph called the "tworm" graph,
and a report produced by the front-end called "tcpworm.txt".  The graph
counts suspected worms in terms of external and internal IP src addresses.
The IP source addresses of boxes deemed suspicious in terms of tcp syn scanning
acc. to a very rude metric (sins sent - fins received > 40) are stored along
with counts in the front-end tcpworm.txt file.

5. experimental udp and icmp top n lists have been added.  These are triggered
by the icmp error config filter name.  The icmp graphs in the back-end show
the top ICMP error producer and give some information about the ip src associated
with those errors.  The UDP error graphs show the IP source for a udp generating
host and are ranked as follows according to weighted metric suggested by 
Dave Burns at PSU:  udp packets sent - udp packets received * (icmp errors).
ICMP errors include ICMP unreachables of various types, ICMP ttl exceeded, and
ICMP redirects returned to the IP source in question.

6. top of top sorting code much improved, sorts available for ip/udp/icmp/and topsyn.
dns caching code put in perl scripts as well to improve performance.  However
running a dns cache-only server on the ourmon back-end is not the worst idea.
The icmp report and the top syn report are both excellent sources of worm/virus
activity.  

6. totally new logging sub-system.  All topn graphs are now logged.  Logging
should be turned on in the configuration.  mon.lite and new tcpworm.txt front-end
reports should be logged as well.  One week of logging is provided.
The log files are saved in the mrourmon directory under logs.

7. various bpf-set graphs have been added that show useful network baseline information
aimed at detection intrusions.  These include the total number of  TCP syns, fins, resets.
Various general errors, and specific ICMP unreachable errors.  

8. Brunson Moody (PSU student) has given us a new capability for detection of IP destination
and IP L4 TCP/UDP destination port scans.  We have 4 graphs that show:
	1. 1 ip src to many ip dst top scans.
	2. 1 ip src to many L4 ports (combined tcp/udp)
	3. 1 ip src to many TCP dst ports.
	4. 1 ip src to many UDP dst ports.

ourmon 2.2

0. INSTALL document much improved.

1. drawtopn and omupdate.pl debugging framework added and a number of
bugs due to zero counts fixed.

2. topn_port filter added. allows topn_ports 10 ... 100 with multiple
histographs, 10 per graph.  graphs topn ports in use.  No syslog logging
with this facility at present.

3. topn flows now includes topn_icmp.  

4. 6 bpf lines per bpf graph instead of 4.
Note:
The real problem here is not bpf lines in the front-end.
It's discernable colors in the pictures in the back-end.

5. nasty bpf xtra bug fixed.

6. ourmon now works with syslog ... hopefully if malloc
runs out of space with topn-style filters, that will be logged (as opposed to lost).

7. ourmon runs in background (calls daemon(3)).  Thus script that
checks to see if ourmon has gone away, can get it going without itself
being stuck as the parent.

8. the ourmon front-end has a optional switch called sysname, that
essentially allows ourmon front-end work to be split up with different
boxes doing different work and all shown on the same back-end web page.
The switch itself simply is used for labeling the pkts count/drops filter,
so that one can see if different probes are losing packets.
See INSTALL for more information on how to set up two different probes
with one backend graphs engine.

9. instance handles off by default in configure script.

10. a number of generally useful bpf graphs have been added
to the base supplied config file.

ourmon 2.0

1. configure script for installation of front-end and back-end.

2. bpf graph mechanism created ... multiple bpfs possible.

ourmon 1.6

changes from previous versions

1. drawtopn debugging and reformatting done.  It won't hang
	on dns gethostbyname (at least as much).  It is still buggy
	though.  Needs to be rewritten or at least have malloc
	eliminated.

2. ipbatch scripts added which will nicely sort topn logs to
	produce top of top output for daily/weekly.   

3. general bpf filter capability added.  ourmon.conf etc.
	can have a fair number of bpf based counters. 

----------------------------------------------------------
ourmon 1.4

changes from 1.3

1. logging support for putting all topn info into syslog.
	This may be turned on/off in omupdate.pl script.
2. added fixed size measurement that uses rrdtool
3. added DNS support for topn pictures.
